        "1.  **Create Specialized Tools:** Develop custom functions that the agent can use to perform specific tasks, such as fetching current stock prices or company details from the internet. Also, integrate a general web search tool.\n",
        "2.  **Build the Agent:** Combine a powerful language model (the \"brain\") with the specialized tools. This agent will be able to understand user requests, decide which tool to use (if any), use the tool, and then formulate an answer based on the results. It's designed to \"think\" and \"act\" in a loop.\n",
        "3.  **Prepare Test Scenarios:** Create a set of realistic questions or tasks that a user might ask the agent. For each question, also note down what an ideal interaction would look like, especially which tools the assistant *should* use.\n",
        "4.  **Automate Test Case Generation:** Develop a process to run the agent with each test question and automatically record its final answer and exactly how it used its tools (which tools it called, what information it gave them, and what results it got back).\n",
        "5.  **Define Success Criteria (Metrics):** Establish clear ways to measure the agent's performance. For example:\n",
        "    *   How well did it complete the user's task?\n",
        "    *   Did it use the correct tools for the job?\n",
        "6.  **Evaluate the Agent:** Run all the test scenarios through the agent and use the success criteria to score its performance. This will provide insights into its strengths and weaknesses."

        "1.  **Tool Definition (`@tool` decorator):** The `@tool` decorator from LangChain automatically converts the Python function `get_stock_price` into a LangChain `Tool` object. This makes it easy for the agent to understand and use this function.\n",
        "2.  **Function Signature (`def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> str:`):**\n",
        "    *   It takes one argument: `ticker` (a string representing the stock symbol, e.g., \"AAPL\").\n",
        "    *   It's type-hinted to return a string (either the price information or an error message).\n",
        "3.  **Docstring:** The docstring is crucial. LangChain agents use the docstring to understand what the tool does, what inputs it expects, and when to use it. A clear and descriptive docstring helps the LLM make better decisions about tool usage.\n",
        "4.  **Fetching Data (`yf.Ticker(ticker)`):** It uses the `yfinance` library to get a `Ticker` object for the given symbol.\n",
        "5.  **Price Retrieval Logic:**\n",
        "    *   It first tries to get the closing price from the most recent day's history (`stock.history(period=\"1d\")`).\n",
        "    *   **Fallback Mechanism:** If the history is empty or doesn't contain a closing price (which can happen for various reasons, e.g., after market close, for certain types of tickers), it tries an alternative method: fetching `stock.info` (a dictionary of various data points) and looking for `currentPrice` or `regularMarketPrice`. This makes the tool more robust.\n",
        "6.  **Formatting Output:** The retrieved price is formatted into a user-friendly string (e.g., \"The current stock price for AAPL is $150.25.\").\n",
        "7.  **Error Handling (`try...except`):** If any error occurs during the process (e.g., invalid ticker, network issue, rate limiting), it catches the exception, prints an error message to the console, and returns a descriptive error message to the agent. This prevents the agent from crashing and allows it to potentially inform the user or try a different approach."

        "The function defined below automates the process of running the agent with a query and packaging the interaction details into a format suitable for DeepEval (`LLMTestCase`).\n",
        "1.  **Function Definition:**\n",
        "    *   Takes `test_query` (the user's question), the `agent` itself, and `expected_tools` (a list of tools we anticipate the agent *should* call for this query) as input.\n",
        "    *   Returns an `LLMTestCase` object.\n",
        "2.  **Prepare Agent Input:**\n",
        "    *   `inputs = {\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=test_query)]}`: Formats the query into the structure the agent expects. `HumanMessage` represents input from a human user.\n",
        "3.  **Invoke Agent:**\n",
        "    *   `response = agent.invoke(inputs)`: Runs the agent with the query. The `response` contains the full sequence of messages exchanged during the agent's operation.\n",
        "4.  **Extract Actual Output:**\n",
        "    *   `actual_output = response['messages'][-1].content`: The agent's final answer is assumed to be the content of the last message in the sequence.\n",
        "5.  **Extract Tool Call Details (Two-Pass Approach):** This is the core logic for understanding how the agent used its tools.\n",
        "    *   **Initialization:** `tools_called_list`, `tool_call_invocations`, `tool_outputs_map` are initialized to store extracted information.\n",
        "    *   **First Pass (Iterate through messages):**\n",
        "        *   **Identify Tool Invocations (`AIMessage`):** When the LLM decides to use a tool, it emits an `AIMessage` containing `tool_calls`. Each `tool_call` has a `name`, `args` (parameters), and an `id`. This pass extracts these details and stores them in `tool_call_invocations`.\n",
        "            *   `json.loads(tool_call['args'])`: Tool arguments are often JSON strings and need to be parsed into Python dictionaries.\n",
        "        *   **Map Tool Outputs (`ToolMessage`):** When a tool executes, its result is returned to the agent in a `ToolMessage`. This message includes the `tool_call_id` (linking it back to the `AIMessage` that requested the tool) and the `content` (the tool's output). This pass populates `tool_outputs_map` to associate each tool call ID with its output.\n",
        "    *   **Second Pass (Construct `ToolCall` objects):**\n",
        "        *   Iterates through the `tool_call_invocations` collected in the first pass.\n",

        "6.  **Create `LLMTestCase`:**\n",
        "    *   An `LLMTestCase` object is instantiated. This is the standard format DeepEval uses to represent a single test scenario.\n",
        "    *   It's populated with:\n",

        "\n",
        "In the code block below, we define several specific test scenarios and uses the `create_test_case_from_query` function to generate DeepEval `LLMTestCase` objects for each.\n",
        "1.  **Defining Queries:** Four distinct queries (`test_query1` was defined earlier, `test_query2`, `test_query3`, `test_query4`) are created. Each query is designed to test different aspects of the agent's capabilities:\n",
        "    *   `test_query1`: Implied needs (financial performance suggests stock price, updates suggest news).\n",
        "    *   `test_query2`: Specific company info and competitive news (tests `get_company_info` and general search).\n",
        "    *   `test_query3`: Multiple requests for one company, including handling an invalid input (tests `get_stock_price` for valid and invalid tickers, and news).\n",
        "    *   `test_query4`: Comparison requiring multiple tool calls for different entities and synthesis of information.\n",
        "2.  **Setting Expected Tools:** For each test case, a list of `expected_tools` is provided. This list tells DeepEval which tools we anticipate the agent *should* ideally call to answer the query effectively.\n",
        "    *   `ToolCall(name='get_stock_price')`: This indicates that we expect the `get_stock_price` tool to be called. The `ToolCorrectnessMetric` will use this information.\n",
        "    *   Note: For `tavily_search_results`, it's often harder to specify it as an \"expected tool\" unless the query very explicitly demands a search. The examples focus on the custom financial tools. The `ToolCorrectnessMetric` in DeepEval checks if *all* tools listed in `expected_tools` were called, and if *only* tools that are relevant (which can be a broader set than just `expected_tools` if the agent uses others appropriately) were called.\n",
        "3.  **Generating Test Cases:** `create_test_case_from_query` is called for each query, passing the query, the agent, and the corresponding `expected_tools`. The results (`test_case1`, `test_case2`, etc.) are `LLMTestCase` objects.\n",
        "4.  **Aggregating Test Cases:**\n",
        "    *   `test_cases = [test_case1, test_case2, test_case3, test_case4]`: All generated `LLMTestCase` objects are collected into a single list, `test_cases`, which will be fed into the DeepEval evaluation function.\n"
