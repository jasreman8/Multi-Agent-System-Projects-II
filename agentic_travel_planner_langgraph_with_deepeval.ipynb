        "Travel planning is a complex and time-consuming process that involves multiple interdependent decisions, such as:\n",

        "- itinerary planning, and\n",
        "- logistics coordination.\n",

        "Challenges like: i) information overload and ii) budget management are common. Furthermore, personalization and external constraints—such as iii) local weather, iv) communication/language barriers, and v) local holidays/events (specially in international travel) — must also be considered during trip planning.\n",

The system utilizes a modular design with *specialized agents & tools for destination suggestion, weather checking, itinerary planning, ticket availability, hotel suggestions, activity recommendations, and external factor analysis (e.g., holidays, language barriers)*. The system utilizes below two multi-agent modular design patterns with specialized agents:\n",
